# Zepto Inventory Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Zepto(one of the most popular quick commerce application in India) inventory dataset to derive key business insights. This analysis aims to calculate the revenue in each product category, discount percentage applied to each product category, and the way in which products are categorised.

## 2.Data Source
The data for this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palvinder2006/zepto-inventory-dataset/data?select=zepto_v2.csv. The dataset contains 3732 rows and 9 columns including Category, name, mrp, discountPercent,availableQuantity, discountedSellingPrice, weightInGms, outOfStock, quantity.

## 3.Data Cleaning and Transformation
The raw data underwent several crucial cleaning and transformation steps to ensure accuracy, consistency, and suitability for analysis. This included:

**Column Addition:** An additional column has been added by the name of *SKU_ID* to uniquely identify each product.

**Handling Zero Values:** Rows where *mrp* is 0 has been removed.

**Currency Conversion:** To enable proper analysis, the currency of *mrp* column has been converted to rupees from paisa.

## 4.Analysis and Methodology
This project was carried out entirely in PostgreSQL. The methodology followed a structured approach of data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using SQL queries to derive meaningful business insights.
